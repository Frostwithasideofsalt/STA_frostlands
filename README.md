Supertux Advance: frostlands is a mod of the game supertux advance made by FrostC, which has 10 new, unique levels, 
custom assets, and more. 

--IMPORTANT-- 

-the license(s) behind lots of the music in this mod are unknown! so I suggest that you don't use this music in your projects. 
additionally, this could lead to the *possiblity* of video demonetization on sites like youtube. 
To avoid this, remove the game audio. if your music happens to be used in this mod, and you don't want it to be used, 
make a github issue.

(both of the issues above don't exist in newer, contrib world version of frostlands, found built into the base game. so go play that!)
