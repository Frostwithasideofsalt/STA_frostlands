# Development Plans

## Characters

* **Tux**: Mostly completed. All I really have left to make for Tux is his earth form. For this, I'd like to have his slide be replaced with rolling into a boulder. Mechanics-wise, he would no longer swim, but instead, walk underwater as though there was no water at all. It would also make him immune to water currents. He'd also be heavier, having higher gravity than his other forms.

* **Konqi**: Konqi will have a more Spyro-like gameplay. He can use his wings to slow his fall even without an air feather, and has a short-range flame in neutral and earth forms. In fire form, he gains an explosive fireball that bursts on contact with any surface. Ice form grants the same speed boost as for Tux, and replaces the flame breath with ice breath. He does not have a slide, but can ground pound. Earth form will grant him the same boulder roll as Tux. In air form, Konqi breathes lightning.

In the air, Konqi can execute a ground pound by pressing down. This will let him break blocks from above, and can hit note blocks harder to gain extra height.

* **Midi**: Midi has a full four energy points in all forms (minus difficulty penalty, of course). His bombs will change element with each elemental powerup, fire, ice, and lightning, and can be fired in eight directions. Earth form replaces his bombs with stone boomerangs. His appearance remains the same with all elements. Rather than depend on flight, levels will be designed with alternative paths for Midi that include monkey bars/vines for him to climb across on. He can also plant mines by shooting directly down while on the ground, and jump from them to detonate them and launch himself into the air. The sneak button will make Midi hold still so he can aim around without having to move.

Double tapping down or sliding into a narrow space will make him curl into his transphere, which behaves like the morphball from Metroid, except that it responds to slopes and only appears to be rolling when in motion. Bombs can be dropped in this form, and will behave like they do in Metroid, defying gravity and exploding after a short time. Due to limited energy, infinite bomb jumping can't be done.

## Enemies

* **Snail**: Works like a koopa troopa. Red will walk off edges, blue will turn around, and punkle will climb walls.

* **Haywire**: Works like Carl Boom, but instead of standing still, it chases after the player for a few seconds before exploding.
